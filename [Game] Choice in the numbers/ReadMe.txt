Note: This is my first C# code outside of unity's C#.
This was coded in Visual Studio.

This is a choice based survival game.
Your goal is to survive 7 nights and face the final boss, throughout the week you'll need to manage your supplies and find new ones.
The game has a guide inside it and even has cheat codes!
Note: The game was designed to be difficult.
