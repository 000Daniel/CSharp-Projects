Version 1.0.0

This is the first version of my Console Command program.
I haven't developed much use for it yet.
Note: this project was a coding practice.

This was programmed on Visual Studio (.Net 5.0).

In this program you can enter a variety of commands.
Note: to get a list of the commands available write 'help' and press enter.
I used my other project 'Word Separetor' to run as the framework to this software.

This software can handle unnecessary spaces, capital and small letters not in order.
Example
Input:
    There   ARE  a LoT OF spaces.
    
software output:
there are a lot of spaces.
