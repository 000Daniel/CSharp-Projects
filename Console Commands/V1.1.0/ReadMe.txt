Version 1.1.0

In this program you can enter a variety of commands.
Note: to get a list of the commands available write 'help' and press enter.

Note: this project was a coding practice.

This software was programmed on Visual Studio (.Net 5.0).
I used my other project 'Word Separetor' to run as the framework to this software.

ChangeLog:
-Added a path/cd command
  this command can change directories as well as open .exe programs.
-Fixed color list
  now when writing 'color' the colons(separating between light and dark colors) will be white.
