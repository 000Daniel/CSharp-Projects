This program allows you to enter and use a variety of commands.
Note: to get a list of the commands available write 'help' and press enter.

Note: this project is a coding practice, so expect issues with it.

This software was programmed on Visual Studio (.Net 5.0).
I used my other project 'Word Separetor' to run as the framework to this software.
