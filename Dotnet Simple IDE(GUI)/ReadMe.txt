This software allows you to write C#(.Net 5.0) code, run it and even compile it to .exe!
The entire idea behind this IDE(Integrated Development Environment) is to provide a simple code editor and compiler.

Note: this software won't allow you to run or compile your code if you do not have .Net 5.0 installed!
