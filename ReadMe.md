# C# Projects Repository

Each folder holds a different project of mine.  
<br />
Some folders might contain multiple versions of a project of mine.   
<br />
Feel free to look around and try some of those programs/scripts for yourself.  
<br />
<br />
<br />
### Note:  
   🞄 Usually I write my C#(C Sharp) projects in Visual Studio Community/Code or OnlineGDB.  
<br />
   🞄 Usually I use the DotNet5.0 and or DotNet6.0 frameworks.  
<br />
   🞄 My projects usually are coding exercises, issues are to be expected.  
<br />
   🞄 Publish date - refers to the upload date of the project.  
<br />
   🞄 Release date - refers to when was the project finished.
